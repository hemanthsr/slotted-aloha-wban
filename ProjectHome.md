This is a simple discrete-event simulator for the slotted Aloha protocol specified in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard for wireless body area networks (WBAN).

With nodes/packets of two priority classes taken into account, throughput, collision probability and latency are estimated from a number of runs.
System model considered to be a single hop network without hidden nodes, and with ideal channel conditions.

The simulation is meant for validating the analysis carried out in the associated paper published in the IEEE Wireless Communication Letters (Title: Saturation Throughput Analysis of IEEE 802.15.6 Slotted Aloha in Heterogeneous Conditions, Digital Object Identifier 10.1109/WCL.2014.021714.140008)
