This is a simple discrete-time event-driven simulator for the slotted Aloha protocol specified in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard for wireless body area networks (WBAN). 

With nodes/packets of two priority classes, throughput, collision probability and latency are estimated from a number of runs. 

System model considered to be single hop network without hidden nodes, and with ideal channel conditions.
