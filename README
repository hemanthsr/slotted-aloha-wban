This is a simple discrete-time event-driven simulator for the slotted Aloha protocol specified in the IEEE 802.15.6 standard for Wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN). 

With nodes/packets of two priority classes, saturation throughput, collision probability and latency are estimated from a number of runs. 

System model considered to be single hop network without hidden nodes, and with ideal channel conditions.

The simulation is meant to validate the analysis carried out in the associated research paper published in the IEEE Wireless Communication Letters (Title: Saturation Throughput Analysis of IEEE 802.15.6 Slotted Aloha in Heterogeneous Conditions). Procedure and assumptions are summarized at Section III of the above paper.
